			<h3>Science is the best method we have for understanding the universe.</h3>


			<span class="image main"><img src="images/methane-painting-web-560.jpg" alt=""/></span>


			<h4>Clarity</h4>
			<p>The Scientific method shines through the complexities of our world. The universe does not owe us easy answers. Science is our shared struggle to make the murky and complex nature of the cosmos a little more clear.</p>

			<h4>Dispelling Prejudice</h4>

			<p>Our brains prefer to seek out information that confirms what we already believe. This leads us to count the "hits" and ignore the "misses". Our prejudices over-inform our conclusions. Science is a way we correct this. It allows us to sweep away generalizations and discover what's true.</p>

			<h4>Discovery More, Forever</h4>

			<p>The vastness and strangeness of the universe cannot be overstated. It is beautiful, destructive, and infinitely complex. With science, we can hope to understand and learn things we couldn't even fathom before. Its pursuit is one that forever feeds the curious.</p>

			<h3>Science is for Everyone</h3>

			<span class="image main"><img src="images/burdock-web-560.jpg" alt=""/></span>

			<h4>Unity of Progress</h4>
			<p>No group of people, political party, or moment in history owns Science. It belongs to all people. It is a human endeavor. Every improvement of understanding, new technology, or new question builds on the shared foundations of all peoples who seek truth and share their discoveries. The wages of science are paid to all generations.</p>

			<h4>Open and Inviting</h4>
			<p>The intuitions of science must remain vigilant against walls erected around its domain. Science is an open process. Efforts to exclude people from science inherently limit science. Efforts to suppress its findings and rob us all of knowledge.   No one knows where the next important idea will come from. It's too risky to count anyone out.</p>

			<h4>Enthusiasts</h4>

			<p>The marvels of scientific discovery are not lost on those that work in other fields. Science has taken us to the moon, connected the world, and helped us thrive. These are accomplishments all people can admire. Science isn't just for those that labor in its name. It is supported equally by those that defend it and share its wonder.</p>

			<h3>Science is an active process</h3>

			<span class="image main"><img src="images/glacier-web-560.jpg" alt=""/></span>

			<h4>Much to learn</h4>

			<p>We still don't fully understand why gravity works the way it does. We are perplexed by our energy crisis, the enigma of consciousness, and how best to treat numerous ailments. There is much still to learn and do. Science is an active field that needs your input.</p>

			<h4>Promotion</h4>

			<p>Science should be celebrated! The world around is abloom with the achievements of science. Our past tells epics of human ingenuity, where the unknowable was suddenly brought before us. Our future, too, will thrive with what we are yet to create and know. In our small corner of this spiral galaxy we call the Milky Way, let us be proud to say we humans created a way to understand the depths, the heights, and what lies within.</p>

			<h4>Vanguards</h4>

			<p>The findings of Science are not always intuitive or easy to understand. The universe is complex, and resists being easily defined. Sometimes this leads to misinformation about scientific discoveries, or even attacks on science itself. Science is a human process, and it can only continue to deliver if we continue to defend it.</p>

			<h3>Our Mission</h3>

			<p class="lead">The March for Science champions robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity. We unite as a diverse, nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good and for political leaders and policy makers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest.</p>

			<p>The March for Science is a celebration of science.  It's not about scientists or politicians; it is about the very real role that science plays in each of our lives and the need to respect and encourage research that gives us insight into the world.  Nevertheless, the march has generated a great deal of conversation around whether or not scientists should involve themselves in politics. In the face of an alarming trend toward discrediting scientific consensus and restricting scientific discovery, we might ask instead: can we afford not to speak out in its defense?</p>

			<p>People who value science have remained silent for far too long in the face of policies that ignore scientific evidence and endanger both human life and the future of our world. New policies threaten to further restrict scientists’ ability to research and communicate their findings.  We face a possible future where people not only ignore scientific evidence, but seek to eliminate it entirely.  Staying silent is a luxury that we can no longer afford.  We must stand together and support science.</p>

			<p>The application of science to policy is not a partisan issue. Anti-science agendas and policies have been advanced by politicians on both sides of the aisle, and they harm everyone — without exception. Science should neither serve special interests nor be rejected based on personal convictions. At its core, science is a tool for seeking answers.  It can and should influence policy and guide our long-term decision-making.</p>

			<p>The March for Science champions and defends science and scientific integrity, but it is a small step in the process toward encouraging the application of science in policy.  We understand that the most effective way to protect science is to encourage the public to value and invest in it.</p>

			<p>The best way to ensure science will influence policy is to encourage people to appreciate and engage with science. That can only happen through education, communication, and ties of mutual respect between scientists and their communities — the paths of communication must go both ways. There has too long been a divide between the scientific community and the public. We encourage scientists to reach out to their communities, sharing their research and its impact on people's everyday lives.  We encourage them, in turn, to listen to communities and consider their research and future plans from the perspective of the people they serve.  We must take science out of the labs and journals and share it with the world.</p>

				<h3>MARCH FOR SCIENCE RELEASES LOCATION DETAILS FOR APRIL 22ND</h3>

				<p>February 24, 2017 (Seattle, WA)--The March For Science Seattle announced today that the location of our rally has been approved by an inter-agency task force. People from across King County will gather in Occidnetal Park in
					historic Pioneer Square, at 10:00am on April 22, 2017. The Stranger reported on this update on DAY, DATE.</p>

				[LINK]

				<p>The planning process will be ongoing until days before the march, and we will continue to work
					closely with the National Park Service, Metropolitan Police Department, and other agencies to ensure a safe march with all logistics in place to accommodate the number of people we anticipate convening. For security reasons, we
					will not release any further details about march logistics until a later date.</p>

				<p>The March For Science in Seattle aims to send a message to all levels of government, including but not limited to the incoming Presidential administration, that we stand together in solidarity and we expect elected leaders to act
					to protect the rights of scientists, their families and their communities.</p>

			<h3>Earth Supporter Shirt</h3>

			<p>With the advent of a new administration, it’s a worrying time for lovers of Science. Federal
				agencies have been forced to silence their social media presence. The administration has ordered
				that studies or data from the Environmental Protection Agency, including content on the EPA
				website, must be reviewed by political appointees before being released to the public. March for
				Science-Seattle will unite scientists and the pro-Science community, to make our voice
				heard!</p>

			<p>Our goal is to promote the respect for, and use of, Science in public discourse and public
				policy, but we can’t do it without help.</p>
